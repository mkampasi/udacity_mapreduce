<p>I downloaded python 2.7, downloaded notepad++, set up my Run Python shortcut per @XavierP suggestion, and saved a very simple file (new.py).  Whenever I try to run my file, the ""blackbox"" briefly appears and disappears.  (where blackbox is like the old DOS box).  I am running on XP.  </p>
<p>The file contains </p>
<p>x=1 <br>
print x</p>
<p>I believe the Python download is ok because I can run in IDLE (but I can't get used to the &gt;&gt;&gt; at the beginning of every line, and it is not intuitive for things like adding a line above an existing line....)  I sure would like to be able to run my files from notepad++.</p>
<p>Any ideas what I might be doing wrong?  (This all is very new to me - I had to Wikipedia IDE and don't understand the command line options for notepad++ shortcuts....)  But it is very interesting, and I'd really appreciate it if anyone has suggestions.</p>

"9006956"	"Karma Do you know what it is?"	"ph100 discussion karma tshirt"	"100066904"	"<p>So I was thinking............what the heck is this forum thing?  What they hack are these points.......what is a user..........badges........we dont need any stinking badges.  For the first week I just did the problems and that was about it.  But then the problems got a little trickier and I had to find some help........so I went to the forums because I had to ........and I asked questions and I only looked in the areas where I was looking for answers.....the minimum. But slowly things began to change and I realized there were some interesting things that were out there and there were some things that were discussed that did not relate directly to the questions.  I saw a lot of people being really helpful and really smart. I was outside looking in. Then one day........I dont know when.....someone asked a question and I tried to be helpful and it worked and I got some points and it was like ok this is neat, helping people. That is really the lesson though of Udacity......sure you can learn things but without the forum where is the fun.  It is like playing video soccer vs being on the field with real people.  I think they ought to send out Karma shirts with a little quote like</p>
<p>“A great human revolution in just a single individual will help achieve a change in the destiny of a nation and, further, can even enable a change in the destiny of all humankind.”</p>
<p>this is an idea that just came to me......and you can quote me....David Benson ......ok.......no it was not me it was stolen off of some Karma site but it sounds good.  Have the quote on the back of the Tshirt.......the Udacity logo on the front and maybe the karma points on the sleeve. 500 1.0k 1.5k 2.0k 2.5k.......so we have not gone completely un American and we like to compete a little bit and show achievement but it is subtle and on the side.  What a great talking point.........what a great way of advertising.  But I remember awhile back thinking.......I can be helpful like Boogs, Rosa, Oldschool and Kedr were and this learning thing would not be as rich and enjoyable if there was not the exchange in the forum.  It was great to have some one to help you out.  So if you want a  Udacity Tshirt with your karma points all you have to do is earn 500 and Andy will get you one.  So cast your vote.......up vote this little question and Andy will see what he can do.  Ok......so maybe he cant do that but it is a nice idea isnt it?   I have to say that Ferris Buellers Day Off is my favorite movie and I like his humor and sometimes I know this is Physics but I like to have a little humor and for all of those people who did order the books from amazon for Longitude ( see posting ) I got so many toaster ovens that I am now selling them in a little shop and making some great money.

<p>OK, so test 1 and 2 are supplied in the HW. Test 3 has separators at the end and beginning of the string and makes sure there is no error when a space is included in the user-provided separator string. Test 4 makes sure there isn't an error if an empty list of separators is passed into the function. Test 5 and 6, checks for errors when the string is empty (with a separator list or an empty separator list). The final test makes sure everything is fine if the last character is not a separator and it checks for an error if the user includes a separator more than once. I thought this was where I might have gone wrong, but the output looks good.</p>

I already spent my time so I'll share anyways or it would probably be a double waste lol</p>
<blockquote>
<p>First I got this incorrect, but I<br>
think what was expected to be the<br>
right answer, is what actually is<br>
incorrect, and this is why. I'm giving<br>
numbers to the statements so we can<br>
refer to them as number ""N"" later</p>
<h2>1</h2>
<p>a = x <br>
a = a + 1</p>
<p>I think is answer was not correct. I<br>
did not select this one. First line:<br>
Here ""a"" refers to ""x"". If you print<br>
""a"" at this point you will get ""x"" as<br>
result right?. We are all right so<br>
far. Second line: ""a"" refers to ""a +<br>
1"" which is the same as ""x + 1"". Here<br>
is what I think is wrong. Peter says<br>
it is correct because you still have<br>
""x"", yeah plus one, but still ""x"", I<br>
think he is not paying attetion to<br>
that ""+ 1"" because even when you still<br>
have ""a"" on the right, which values<br>
""x"", if you print thet variable ""a"" at<br>
this point, you get ""x + 1"" as result<br>
which is NOT the same as ""x"" on the<br>
first line. If ""x"" values ""2"" you<br>
would get ""3"" as result in the end,<br>
which is not the same as the first ""x""</p>
<p>In short, he evaluated what ""a"" refers<br>
to, no matter else was there, no<br>
matter that ""+ ...""</p>
<p>Now  lets see this other statement</p>
<h2>2</h2>
<p>x = x + 1 <br>
x = x</p>
<p>First line: ""x"" on the left is a<br>
variable, ""x + 1"" is a value for that<br>
variable. ""x"" values ""x + 1"" Right?<br>
Good. Taking his color and figures<br>
technique (which I like actually),<br>
here we have the new color ""red<br>
triangle + 1"" as he said, but in the<br>
answer video, he is still thinking of<br>
""x"" as ""red triangle"" but this is not<br>
correct, ""x"" is not ""red triangle""<br>
anymore. This is a new statement an<br>
""x"" can have any new value, so in this<br>
case is ""red triangle + 1"" which is ""x<br>
+ 1"" Ok now, second line: ""x"" on the left refers to ""x"" on the right which<br>
yes? and the ""x"" on the right already<br>
values ""x + 1"" which is the new color<br>
""red triangle + 1"" yes? so this is the<br>
same color, the same value it was<br>
before. Correct? If you print ""x"" in<br>
the end, you will get ""x + 1"" as<br>
result which was you first value for<br>
""x"" --for this new statement-- so<br>
""which of the following statements<br>
leave the value of --vaiable ""x"" the<br>
same-- as it was before the statement""</p>

"1017359"	"HW 3.2 - a Markov Chain"	"cs373 eigenvectors markov markovchain hw3-2"	"100008318"	"<p>This problem is a simple example of a Markov-chain.  I recall first encountering this concept decades ago when I overheard some physics grad students studying for their comprehensive exams.  A problem that had appeared on a comp in a previous year involved something like this:  </p>
<p>Three people are passing a ball around. Person A passes the ball to person B with probability .3, and to person C with probability .7;  person B passes the ball to person A with probability .6 and to person C with probability .4;  and person C passes the ball to person A or person B with equal probabilities. In the long run, what proportion of time will each person have the ball?  </p>
<p>I won't go into the formal details, but the actual process of solving this problem is fairly easy... You make a matrix of all those probabilities (so that the columns sum to 1).  Raise that matrix to a high power, and the answer to the question is repeated in each column of the resulting power matrix (which has converged to its eigenvectors).  </p>
<p>So to solve that given problem, create the transition probability matrix:  </p>
<pre><code>[[0.0,  0.6,  0.5],
 [0.3,   0.0,  0.5],
 [0.7,   0.4,  0.0]]
</code></pre>
<p>Raising that matrix to the 100 power, we get:</p>
<pre><code>[[ 0.35242291,  0.35242291,  0.35242291],
 [ 0.28634361,  0.28634361,  0.28634361],
 [ 0.36123348,  0.36123348,  0.36123348]]
</code></pre>
<p>Which can be interpreted to mean that person A will have the ball about 35% of the time, person B 29%, and person C 36% of the time. </p>
<p>The same process works to solve problems such as this one:  </p>
<p>Suppose there are 3 states with the following migration patterns.  Those who live in state A, remain there with probability .7, while with probability .2 they will move to state B, and with probability .1 they will move to state C.  Of those who live in state B, 10% move to state A, 60% stay in state B, and 30% move to state C.  And finally, of those who live in state C, 15% move to state A, 65% move to state B, and 20% stay in state C.  Initially the population of the states (respectively) are (in millions)  10, 20, 30.  In the long run, what will the populations be of these 3 states?  </p>
<p>The transition probability matrix for this Markov process is:  </p>
<pre><code>[[ 0.7, 0.1, 0.15],
 [ 0.2, 0.6, 0.65],
 [ 0.1, 0.3, 0.2]]
</code></pre>
<p>Raising this matrix to the hundredth power (nothing special about 100, but it seems large enough to have essentially converged to the steady-state solution), we obtain the matrix:</p>
<pre><code>[[ 0.27777778  0.27777778  0.27777778]
[ 0.5         0.5          0.5       ]
[ 0.22222222  0.22222222  0.22222222]]
</code></pre>
<p>Multiplying this 3x3 matrix times the column vector of the initial populations,</p>
<pre><code>[[10.],
 [20.],
 [30.]]
</code></pre>
<p>we obtain the long-term (steady-state) populations of the three states:</p>
<pre><code>[[16.67],
 [30.00],
 [13.33]]
</code></pre>
<p>These examples are 3x3, but the same idea works for nxn systems.</p>"	"question"	"\N"	"\N"	"2012-03-10 23:26:10.987472+00"	"10"	""	"1076121"	"100008318"	"2012-03-13 01:38:02.899762+00"	"1025988"	"\N"	"\N"	"1612"	"f"

"1024239"	"A gripe about unit 4 and some suggestions"	"cs373 python hw4 suggestion"	"100011158"	"<p>First of all, thanks to all of you guys at udacity for doing such an amazing job so far with the course material and coding environment. You make an immensely complex problem like a robot car really simple without drowning the students in silly squiggly math.</p>
<p>Now :<br>
I have a gripe about unit 4 code - In all mainstream programming languages, arrays are stored row major (ignore matlab and fortran)<br>
So far in the course we accessed 2d arrays as grid[y][x] and iterated over x in the inner loop and y in the outer loop - This is extremely natural to someone who does a lot of programming.<br>
The combination of reversing this order and the fact that some of us are not comfortable/familiar with python, makes one do stupid typos while coding. I hope you will maintain a consistent y, x ordering from here on out.</p>
<p>A few suggestions for next time around:</p>
<p>1) Please do not restrict the programming language to python alone! Look at how it's done in topcoder.com and google code jam - You have a problem description and test cases, and a standard template to code with. The choices available there are C++, Java, C#, python and VB.NET - Something for everyone. In fact if you keep your input/output interfaces using simple text files or stdin/stdout, you could allow a huge range of languages. Personally I would be about 10 times faster expressing myself in C++ than python, and its so much more easy for me to detect incorrect code in a language I am familiar with.</p>
<p>2) Display a countdown timer for the homework deadline. </p>
<p>3) After each homework submission deadline, post a proper complete commented solution that works and can be used as a reference to see where we went wrong.</p>
<p>4) In the progress tab, show some information about why the answer was incorrect ( topcoder does this - it shows details about the failed test cases ). We'd like to know if it was our understanding that was wrong or whether it was a coding implementation mistake or whether it was a typo.</p>
<p>So there you go, I hope these suggestions are useful. Anyway the point is were having great fun learning and in the end grades are not so important as the fact that we understood the principles involved.</p>
<p>Thank you once again!</p>"	"question"	"\N"	"\N"	"2012-03-20 08:19:57.6525+00"	"4"	""	"\N"	"100011939"	"2012-03-20 12:22:41.656589+00"	"1033010"	"\N"	"\N"	"300"	"f"

<p>I posted this for the Feb 2012 running of CS101, and we've had to refer to it many times during the running of that course. I am sure there are many new students in this beginner course, so it would be good to get you started off on the right foot. </p>
<p>There are many of us here who spend a lot of time trying to help. One thing I see people doing over and over is posting code, but they don't format it properly, so it's very hard to read, and impossible to copy/paste.</p>
<p>Python is a language where seemingly unimportant things like indents matter. Especially as we move on to functions (procedures) and more complicated code. You could post code that would otherwise work perfectly, but if it's not formatted correctly, we can't tell that you have an indenting problem. If your perfect code does have an indentation problem, it won't run. We can't see that if you don't format your code. </p>
<p>Later in the units, when the code is more than a couple of lines long, it helps us if we can copy and paste it into our IDE's to help you find your problem. If it's not formatted properly, we can't (easily) do that. </p>
<p>""How do I format my code on the forums?"" you may ask... well, it's simple. Let me show you:</p>
<p><img alt=""How to format your code properly for the forums"" src=""http://www.udacity-forums.com/cs101/upfiles/Code_Formatting.png""> </p>
<p>That's all there is to it. If you need to write above or below the code you're posting, just leave a blank line between the code and the non-code text, otherwise the formatting may get screwed up. </p>
<p>You can also format code when your are leaving a comment (rather than a new answer) by using the </p>
<pre><code>&lt;pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Tags. When you leave a comment you don't get the menu above your editor with the little buttons, so this is handy to know. </p>
<p>You could just post your code like this:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;pre&gt;  
def count(input):
    while i &lt;= input:
        i++
    return i
&lt;/pre&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>and it will format as so: </p>
<pre>def count(input):
    while i &lt;= input:
        i++
    return i</pre>
